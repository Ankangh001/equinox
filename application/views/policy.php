Examples of these third parties include the providers of trading platforms on which you choose to trade using our services. Financial data (such as kind of instrument, time of starting and closing a trade), as well as data from social networks (such as profit or loss), are included (user name, profile picture, e-mail address associated with the account on the social network). For details on how trading platform providers and social network operators use your personal information for their own purposes, please refer to their privacy policies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Do you know what we do with the information you provide us?</span>
                    <br/><br/>
                    This is how we make use of personally identifiable information:
                    <br/><br/>
                    Creating a user account and signing up
                    <br/><br/>

                    <br/><br/>
                    Personal information:

                    Your name, email address, and phone number are required to identify you and get in touch with you.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The legal justification for the processing of personal data:
                    <br/><br/>
                    You must provide your personal data to us in order for us to register your user account, as we cannot do so without it.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Providing services, exercising contractual rights and responsibilities, and so on:
