                                                These two steps consist of the evaluation <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">Phase 1 & Phase 2</strong>. The course is specifically tailored to discover talent within a trader. 
                                                The path of a trader is challenging, and our user tools, account analysis and applications are here to guide our traders.
                                                Upon successful completion, traders are offered a placement in the firm, where they can remotely manage up to <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">500,000 USD</strong> and continuously grow the account according to our Scaling Plan.

                                                    <br>

                                                It is difficult to make a living as a trader. With Equinox Trading Capital, you can manage the live account with an initial balance of up to <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">$500,000</strong>. 
                                                If you generate profits on the live account, Equinox Trading Capital will keep from <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">10%</strong> to <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">20%</strong> as the profit split, and you will be rewarded with up to <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">90%</strong> of achieved profits. 
                                                However, it needs to be understood that this is the best-case scenario and similarly, traders might face periods when they donâ€™t earn any profits. 
                                                In general, trading is a risky business. Another benefit of trading for Equinox Trading Capital is that you wonâ€™t be responsible for any losses if any. 
                                                In case things go wrong, all losses on the live account are covered by Equinox Trading Capital. You donâ€™t need to fear losing if you literally have nothing to lose.
                                                <br><br> At Equinox Trading Capital, we are also traders and we understand that to be a great trader, it is not just about having enough capital to trade with. 
                                                The performance of our traders directly reflects the performance of the company. Therefore, it is in our interest that our traders trade under the best conditions. 
                                                Traders at Equinox Trading Capital will receive wide access to our <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">innovative Trading Applications</strong> which can enhance their trading edge and we will also evaluate your trading accounts with detailed feedback from our company.
                                                Then there is trading discipline. You cannot be all loosey-goosey with the live account. 
                                                We will carefully observe your trading results and you will be trading under much easier rules. 
                                                We believe that our rules are not very restrictive but at the same time, they would prevent a disaster if you decided to go on tilt. 
                                                <br><br> No more over-trading, revenge trading, over-leveraging etc. That is why you will learn to manage risk much better once you start trading with us.
                                                Another issue traders face is the so-called â€˜keep and grow or withdraw and goâ€˜. Do you prefer compounding your account or rather enjoy your hard-earned profit? 
                                                At Equinox Trading Capital, you can do both. Equinox Trading Capital will pay out up to <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">90%</strong> profit share on a bi-weekly basis. 
                                                Periodically, we will allocate more balance into your <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">live account</strong> if you consistently profit. <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">Get paid</strong> and grow at the same time according to our scaling plan.
                                                Last but not least, the initial fee that youâ€™ve paid will be refunded to you with the first <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">Profit Split</strong> from the live account.

                                                You donâ€™t need to score any minimum profit to receive up to a <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">90%</strong> Profit Split. 
                                                Whatever amount of profit you generate, thatâ€™s what we split by <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">80/20</strong> (<strong style= "color:#0d6efd">90/10</strong> on the scale-up plan) and pay you out.
                                                If you meet the conditions of our scaling plan, not only do we increase the balance of your live account by <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">50%</strong>, but the payout ratio will also automatically change to a staggering <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">90/10</strong>
                                                If you prefer to keep your <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">profit split</strong> on account to grow and accordingly build up your balance and drawdown buffer, you can do so.

                                            When we create your trading account, you will receive your evaluation notification by email, and your login credentials to the trading platform can be found directly in your client area. Please monitor your mailbox, including spam/junk folders.

                                                The fee mainly serves as a traderâ€™s commitment to treat the account with the utmost care and responsibility.A trader has something in the game and the psychology is working. 
                                                Also, the fee is just a marginal percentage compared to the size of the live account that you will receive after succeeding in the evaluation. In other words, the fee is a key towards the live account and an opportunity to gain financial independence.
                                                The good news is that you cannot lose more than this fee as any potential losses on the live account are covered by us. On top of that, the fee is always refunded back to the trader with his/her first profit split from the live account.
                                                <br><br> The fee also covers the use of all our unique applications, such as the Web Terminal, Advanced Charts, Market Analysis, Calculators, Risk Management Application, Trade Management Application, Account Analysis, Account MetriX and Trading Journal.
                                                Another purpose of the fee is to filter out only the serious traders from those who just keep on trying. We are looking for traders who are experienced and can generate profits. Our capacities and resources are limited, and we simply canâ€™t cater for all the traders out there.
                                                Thatâ€™s why we take on board only those who are serious, committed and responsible. Our programme is a highly valued service we offer, and therefore it is adequately priced.

                                            We do not place any limit on the number of trading accounts you can have in the evaluation phase. However, we have a maximum capital allocation of <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">$500,000</strong> (prior to scaling) per trader or strategy, at any given time for any live account.
                                            These limits are in place due to risk mitigation & diversification as we donâ€™t want to allocate a big portion of our investment on one card.
                                            Please be careful not to get multiple accounts through various registrations as this is not permitted. If we discover identically traded strategies through various accounts, and exceeding <strong style= "color:#0d6efd">$500,000</strong> in the summary of allocated capital value, we reserve the right to suspend those accounts as per the T&Cs.
                                            If you would like to combine your successfully passed evaluation accounts into one master live account, we can do so upon request. 
                                            The live account that is merged has a combined balance value as well as the drawdown limits. 
                                            If you wish to compound your profits, you do not have to withdraw your profits before merging the accounts.

                                                        If you are successful in the Free Trial, you have the best chances to succeed in the full evaluation as well. This should encourage you to start your journey to become one of our traders.
                                                        <br><br> Please note that free trials donâ€™t give you any eligibility to automatically secure your live account. Although your results might be good in the free trial, you still need to go through the evaluation process to become one of our traders.
                                                        Our free trials are extremely popular and we have literally thousands of accounts taken every day. To accommodate the demand, only one free trial per trader is allowed at a time
