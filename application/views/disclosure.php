Futures and FX trading are not suitable for all investors.
<br/><br/>
An investor may lose all or part of their initial investment. Trading should only be done with risk capital—money that can be lost without endangering one's financial stability or lifestyle. This is not a solicitation or offer to buy or sell futures, options, or forex. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
<br/><br/>
There are some restrictions under CFTC Rule 4.41 - Hypothetical or simulated performance outcomes Simulated outcomes do not represent actual trading. Because the deals were not actually performed, the outcomes may have under-or over-compensated for market conditions like lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs are generally created with the advantage of hindsight. Notification that any account will or is likely to generate such profit or loss is made.

Risky Warning:
<br/><br/>
Margin trading CFDs include a high level of risk and are not suited for all investors. Before trading CFDs, you should carefully assess your trading objectives, experience, and risk appetite. You could lose more than your initial investment, so don't deposit anything you can't afford to lose. Understand the hazards and take precautions to manage them.
